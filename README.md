# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, if you don't know what they are look [here](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

## prerequisites

You'll need `homebrew` and `oh-my-zsh`

### Homebrew

Try this, I haven't tested that to be honest so it might now work, if you don't have homebrew after that follow these instructions [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```bash
sh homebrew/install.sh
```

### Oh My Zsh

Follow these instructions [robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

# install

Update later

# inlcudes

Go into detail about brewfile, it's too big
